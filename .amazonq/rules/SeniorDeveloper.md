# Project Development Rule

This rule ensures the project is **unique, simple, and professional**, with smooth transitions, scalability, and best practices in both frontend and backend development.

## 1. General Principles

- Keep the project **clean, simple, and professional**.
- Prioritize **smooth user experience (UX)** with seamless page transitions and responsive design.
- Ensure **readability** and **maintainability** of code at every step.
- Follow **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** and **DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)** principles.

## 2. Project Structure

- Separate **frontend** and **backend** into clear folders.
- Use **React (JSX)** for frontend with **TailwindCSS**.
- Use **Node.js + Express** for backend APIs.
- Database: **MongoDB** (with Mongoose for schema modeling).
- Keep config, routes, services, and utilities modular.
